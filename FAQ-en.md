# FAQ

## Can I update Android™ if I have installed Windows?

✅ Yes! Feel free to do so. All Android™ updates until now have worked fine even if Windows was installed.

## If Qualcomm Technologies Inc. never offered support for the Snapdragon™ 855, then why is this project even a thing?

As common in the chip industry, Chip designs rarely are entirely different in a whole chip generation. The Snapdragon™ 855 is part of the same generation of chips as the Snapdragon™ 8cx and Microsoft SQ1. Differences between these chips aren't a lot, but are enough for the drivers to also not work on the 855. That's why this is sort of possible.

## Will you look into getting this device more mainlined (for linux) in the future?

Maybe.

## I would like to help, how can I reach you

We'll be happy to talk to you on our telegram channel: https://t.me/winonvayualt, note, you can help us with more than driver work, a lot of work is needed as well with documentation, support for the community, testing, developping apps, making a better shell, etc. We welcome any kind of help.

## Are you going to do this for other Snapdragon™ 855 devices?

No, but we regularly share our contributions to the team behind the [WOA msmnile](https://github.com/WOA-msmnile) and [Renegade Project](https://github.com/EDK2-Porting), whose job is to do it for all kinds of other existing Android™ Devices.
